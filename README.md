# Drifter

Drifter is a set of convenience classes, extensions, and utility methods for use with [LibGDX][1].  I maintain this library 
for my personal use, mainly in [Ludum Dare][2] and other game jams.  The intention is to enable super rapid game development 
in Kotlin, with a strong preference for convenience and succinctness over performance or really anything else.
